It is not necessarily due to an increase in cell growth -it may be the result of an increase in the division rate at normal growth rates.  It may not even be due to an increase in the cell division rate - a reduced rate of cell death while the division rate is normal could also achieve it.

In an animal that is heterozygous for a Minute mutation, cells with two wild-type alleles of the affected gene have a growth advantage.  Many developmental studies take advantage of this fact to give somatic clones a growth advantage.  The term 'Minute' should not be used to annotate the resulting phenotypes.

Some, but not all melanotic mass phenotypes involve ectopic activation of this immmune response.

comment: Temporal ordering number - 570. DISAMBIGUATION: In Drosophila lab vernacular, the term 'pupal stage' is often used to refer to the entire period from formation of the puparium to eclosion. However, this does not correspond to the standard usage of 'pupal stage' for Cyclorrhaphous flies (for discussion see: FBrf0087128). Briefly: formation of the puparium (hardening of the larval cuticle) marks the beginning of the pre-pupal stage. The pupal stage begins following pupal/larval apolysis - detachment of the larval epidermis from the puparium. In Drosophila, the outward sign of the completion of apolysis is the eversion of the head and expulsion of the larval mouthparts (FBrf0036849). We use P-stage to refer to the stage from pupariation to eclosion, and restrict pupal stage to its standard usage.

In plants, dormancy may involve the formation of dormant buds, and may be preceded by the senescence of plant parts such as leaves in woody plants or most of the shoot system in herbaceous perennials. The exit from dormancy in vascular plants is marked by resumed growth of buds and/or growth of vascular cambium.

def: "The series of events required for an organism to receive a touch stimulus, convert it to a molecular signal, and recognize and characterize the signal. This is a neurological process. The perception of touch in animals is mediated by mechanoreceptors in the skin and mucous membranes and is the sense by which contact with objects gives evidence as to certain of their qualities. Different types of touch can be perceived (for example, light, coarse, pressure and tickling) and the stimulus may be external or internal (e.g. the feeling of a full stomach)." [GOC:ai]

comment: Note that this term differs from 'cytokinesis ; GO:0000910' in that cytokinesis excludes nuclear division; in prokaryotes, there is little difference between cytokinesis and cell division. Note that there is no relationship between this term and 'nuclear division ; GO:0000280' because cell division can take place without nuclear division (as in prokaryotes) and vice versa (as in syncytium formation by mitosis without cytokinesis.

Associated characteristics of this form of dormancy include reduced morphogenesis, increased resistance to environmental extremes, and altered or reduced behavioral activity. Full expression develops in a species-specific manner, usually in response to a number of environmental stimuli that precede unfavorable conditions. Once diapause has begun, metabolic activity is suppressed even if conditions favorable for development prevail. Once initiated, only certain stimuli are capable of releasing the organism from this state, and this characteristic is essential in distinguishing diapause from hibernation."

comment: There are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'. In this case the quality is 'lacking all parts of type' - it is a (relational) quality of the spermatocyte, and it is with respect to instances of 'aster'. One of the popular requirements of PATO is that it continue to support 'absent', so we need to relate statements which use this quality to the 'lacking all parts of type' quality.\nThere are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'.
