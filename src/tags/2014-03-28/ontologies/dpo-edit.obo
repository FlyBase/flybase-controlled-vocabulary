comment: This phenotype is not necessarily accompanied by overgrowth of a tissue - there may be more cells in an otherwise normal volume of tissue.  It is not necessarily due to an increase in cell growth -it may be the result of an increase in the division rate at normal growth rates.  It may not even be due to an increase in the cell division rate - a reduced rate of cell death while the division rate is normal could also achieve it.

On its own, this is not sufficient evidence for a defect in sensory perception of touch, as motor defects can also cause this phenotype. Internal note -

comment: The phenotype may be a general result of mutations in essential components of the protein synthesis pathyway, as a number of Minutes encode ribosomal proteins. In an animal that is heterozygous for a Minute mutation, cells with two wild-type alleles of the affected gene have a growth advantage.  Many developmental studies take advantage of this fact to give somatic clones a growth advantage.  The term 'Minute' should not be used to annotate the resulting phenotypes.

def: "Phenotype characterised by the formation of lumps of melanotic tissue inside the body in the absence of foreign bodies." [FlyBase:FBrf0094387, FlyBase:FBrf0194475]
comment: Melanotic capsules are formed around foreign bodies in wild-type animals as part of the immune response, for example as a protection against parasitoid wasps. Some, but not all melanotic mass phenotypes involve ectopic activation of this immmune response.  While melanotic masses are commonly referred to as melanotic tumors in the historical listerature, this is a misnomer as they are rarely neoplastic.

comment: In plants and animals, dormancy may be a response to environmental conditions such as seasonality or extreme heat, drought, or cold. In plants, dormancy may involve the formation of dormant buds, and may be preceded by the senescence of plant parts such as leaves in woody plants or most of the shoot system in herbaceous perennials. The exit from dormancy in vascular plants is marked by resumed growth of buds and/or growth of vascular cambium.

Full expression develops in a species-specific manner, usually in response to a number of environmental stimuli that precede unfavorable conditions. Once diapause has begun, metabolic activity is suppressed even if conditions favorable for development prevail. Once initiated, only certain stimuli are capable of releasing the organism from this state, and this characteristic is essential in distinguishing diapause from hibernation."

comment: There are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'. In this case the quality is 'lacking all parts of type' - it is a (relational) quality of the spermatocyte, and it is with respect to instances of 'aster'. One of the popular requirements of PATO is that it continue to support 'absent', so we need to relate statements which use this quality to the 'lacking all parts of type' quality.\nThere are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'.

comment: PATO divides qualities between normal (monadic, singly-occurring) qualities and relational qualities. Relational qualities stand in the 'towards' relation with respect to some additional entity. For example, The sensitivity of an eye towards red light. In some cases we want to represent a quality such as 'protruding' in both monadic and relational branches. We use this relation to link them.\nPATO divides qualities between normal (monadic, singly-occurring) qualities and relational qualities.
