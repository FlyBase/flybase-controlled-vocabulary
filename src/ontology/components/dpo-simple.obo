comment: The phenotype may be a general result of mutations in essential components of the protein synthesis pathway, as a number of Minutes encode ribosomal proteins. In an animal that is heterozygous for a Minute mutation, cells with two wild-type alleles of the affected gene have a growth advantage. Many developmental studies take advantage of this fact to give somatic clones a growth advantage. The term 'Minute' should not be used to annotate the resulting phenotypes.

comment: Melanotic capsules are formed around foreign bodies in wild-type animals as part of the immune response, for example as a protection against parasitoid wasps. Some, but not all melanotic mass phenotypes involve ectopic activation of this immune response. While melanotic masses are commonly referred to as melanotic tumors in the historical literature, this is a misnomer as they are rarely neoplastic.

comment: This term should only be used to report defects specifically in oviposition, as opposed to an overall loss of fertility. If a difference in "oviposition rate" is measured by authors as a proxy for sterility/fertility, it would be better to use the terms "sterile", "semi-sterile", or "semi-fertile", as appropriate.

comment: It is sometimes difficult to define the physical boundaries of a population. In the case of sexually reproducing organisms, the individuals within a population have the potential to reproduce with one another during the course of their lifetimes. 'Community', as often used to describe a group of humans, is a type of population. \n\nClasses for population already  exist in IDO ('organism population', IDO_0000509) and OBI ('population', OBI_0000181). The definitions should be standardized across OBO Foundry ontologies and only one term used.
