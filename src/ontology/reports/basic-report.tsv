<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv_0005072>	"The basic components of a polyA trap cassette are a promoter fused to a gene sequence that lacks a polyadenylation (polyA) sequence but is followed by a splice donor sequence. If the cassette is integrated into the genome outside a gene, the mRNA produced by the polyA trap is not polyadenylated and is expected to be rapidly degraded. However, if the cassette is integrated into an intron, the promoter in the polyA trap will drive expression of a transcriptional fusion containing the polyA gene trap fused to any downstream exons. The downstream terminal exon can provide a polyA signal, allowing stable expression of the gene encoded by the polyA trap. polyA trap cassettes can be used to report the expression of genes that are not normally expressed, or are expressed at very low levels, or may be used as a marker of successful integration of an insertion into a transcription unit. A polyA trap cassette may be inserted into a genome as part of a transgenic construct via transposable-element-mediated transgenesis, or may be inserted directly into a modified endogenous locus via a genome engineering method such as homologous recombination or CRISPR."

A driver encoded by one transgenic locus or modified endogenous locus is used to drive expression of a downstream 'responder' or 'reporter' encoded by another transgenic locus or modified endogenous locus, by fusing the regulatory region sequence to which the driver binds upstream of the responder sequence. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of the responder thus depends on the regulatory elements used to drive expression of the driver.

Typically, constructs containing misexpression elements are designed to insert at or near the 5' end of a gene, such that expression from the promoter within the misexpression element drives overexpression of the endogenous locus and causes a gain-of-function phenotype. However, if the insertion is within a locus, a truncated product may be produced, while an insertion in the opposite orientation to that of the direction of transcription of the endogenous locus can result in the production of an antisense transcript.

An integrase binds a pair of compatible recognition sites (typically called attP and attB) which each contain a short integration core flanked by imperfect inverted repeats that are not identical. Exchange between the attP/attB pair results in the formation of hybrid sites (typically called attL and attR) that are no longer a substrate of the integrase. Thus the exchange reaction driven by an integrase is unidirectional. Mutually exclusive pairs of recognition site have been engineered for some integrases. Integrases can be used to generate many different types of genetic modification, with the outcome being influenced by the relative orientation (direct or inverted), relative location and composition of the two recognition sites. The types of possible modification include deletion of DNA, generation of chromosomal rearrangements, integration of DNA into the genome, and replacement of genetic material with that from a donor plasmid using recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE)."

The recognition site for a particular site-specific recombinase is defined by the enzyme itself. The recognition site contains perfect inverted repeats flanking an asymmetric spacer. Under normal conditions, the two recognition sites are identical and are reformed during the recombination event, and thus the reaction is bidirectional: recombination can occur in both 'forward' and 'reverse' directions. However, recognition sites can be mutated to drive the directionality of the reaction: different classes of site may be combined so that recombination can occur in one direction, but produces reformed sites that are no longer compatible. In addition, mutually exclusive sites have been engineered for some recombinases. Recombinases can be used to generate many different types of genetic modification, with the outcome being influenced by the relative orientation (direct or inverted), relative location and composition of the two recognition sites. The types of possible modification include deletion of DNA, generation of chromosomal rearrangements, integration of DNA into the genome, and replacement of genetic material with that from a donor plasmid using recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE)."

For RMCE mediated by a recombinase, the target cassette is flanked by two non-identical recombinase target sites that each carry a different mutation in the spacer sequence of the target site; this renders the two sites incompatible with each other. A compatible RMCE donor cassette is flanked by the same pair of non-identical sites; in the presence of recombinase, a double recombination event between the identical sites on the donor and target sequences results in replacement of the target cassette with the donor cassette. In the case of RMCE mediated by an integrase, the RMCE cassette is flanked by identical integrase target sites, while a compatible RMCE donor cassette is flanked by copies of the orthogonal integrase target site; in the presence of integrase, a double recombination event results in the target cassette being replaced with that of the donor cassette.

<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv_0005071>	"A gene trap cassette is designed to interrupt transcription of an endogenous locus upon integration of the cassette into the genome. The basic components of a gene trap cassette are a promoterless gene with an upstream splice acceptor site. Upon integration into an intron, splicing from the genomic splice donor site to the splice acceptor site in the cassette results in a transcriptional fusion containing the endogenous exon(s) upstream of the insertion fused to the gene sequence encoded by the cassette. Any open reading frame (ORF) encoded by the trap cassette gene may be translated from this transcriptional fusion either as a translational fusion with any ORF sequence encoded by the upstream exons, or if an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) or viral 2A-like peptide sequence (which promotes ribosome skipping) is present upstream of the gene trap ORF, it may be produced as a separate protein expressed under the control of the regulatory sequences of the endogenous locus. Gene trap insertions are usually mutagenic, disrupting the locus into which they have inserted, since termination sequences are usually present at the 3' end of the cassette, truncating the endogenous transcript. Depending on the nature of the gene encoded by the gene trap cassette, a gene trap insertion may directly report the expression pattern of the disrupted locus (e.g. if it encodes a reporter enzyme or fluorescent protein), or it may be used to drive expression of any gene of interest in the pattern of the trapped locus (e.g. if it is a driver that forms part of a binary expression system). A gene trap cassette may be inserted into a genome as part of a transgenic construct via transposable-element-mediated transgenesis, or may be inserted directly into a modified endogenous locus via a genome engineering method such as homologous recombination or CRISPR."

For RMCE mediated by a recombinase, the target cassette is flanked by two non-identical recombinase target sites that each carry a different mutation in the spacer sequence of the target site; this renders the two sites incompatible with each other. A compatible RMCE donor cassette is flanked by the same pair of non-identical sites; in the presence of recombinase, a double recombination event between the identical sites on the donor and target sequences results in replacement of the target cassette with the donor cassette. In the case of RMCE mediated by an integrase, the RMCE cassette is flanked by identical integrase target sites, while a compatible RMCE donor cassette is flanked by copies of the orthogonal integrase target site; in the presence of integrase, a double recombination event results in the target cassette being replaced with that of the donor cassette.

<http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FBcv_0005070>	"A protein trap cassette is designed to tag protein(s) encoded by an endogenous locus upon integration of the cassette into the genome. The basic structure of a protein trap cassette is an artificial exon composed of a splice acceptor site, an open reading frame without initiation and stop codons, and a splice donor site. No promoter sequences are present. Upon integration into a coding intron of an endogenous locus, the open reading frame (ORF) encoded by the artificial exon can be incorporated into ('tag') the protein encoded by the locus. This only occurs if the insertion is in the correct orientation and when the frame of the artificial exon corresponds to that of the preceeding exon. Thus, only one out of six insertions in a coding intron will function as a protein trap. To account for each reading frame, three versions of a given protein trap element, differing only in the splice phase, are typically produced for use in an insertional mutagenesis screen. Depending on the nature of the ORF encoded by the artificial exon, the tag may be used to detect the expression pattern and/or subcellular localization of the protein (e.g. if the tag is an epitope tag or fluorescent protein), to drive expression of a gene of interest (e.g. if the tag is a driver that forms part of a binary expression system), or may modify the properties of the endogenous protein (e.g. if the tag affects protein localization or stability). A protein trap cassette may be inserted into a genome as part of a transgenic construct via transposable-element-mediated transgenesis, or may be inserted directly into a modified endogenous locus via a genome engineering method such as homologous recombination or CRISPR. The presence of the splice acceptor and donor sites mean that a protein trap cassette is not inherently mutagenic, since it is designed to insert in frame into a protein. However, an insertion into an intron that splits a critical functional or localization domain may alter the activity of the encoded protein, and the protein trap tag sequence itself may be designed to alter function (for example targeting the protein to a new location within the cell or altering its stability)."

If the promoter trap gene encodes an open reading frame (ORF) and the insertion is in the correct frame, the trap ORF may be translated from this transcriptional fusion either as a translational fusion with ORF sequence of the disrupted endogenous locus, or if an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) or viral 2A-like peptide sequence (which promotes ribosome skipping) is present upstream of the promoter trap ORF, it may be produced as a separate protein expressed under the control of the regulatory sequences of the endogenous locus. Depending on the nature of the gene encoded by the promoter trap cassette, the insertion may directly report the expression pattern of the 'trapped' locus (e.g. if the gene encoded by the cassette is a reporter enzyme or fluorescent protein), or it may be used to drive expression of any gene of interest (e.g. if the gene encoded by the cassette is a driver that form part of a binary expression system). A promoter trap cassette may be inserted into a genome as part of a transgenic construct via transposable-element-mediated transgenesis, or may be inserted directly into a modified endogenous locus via a genome engineering method such as homologous recombination or CRISPR.

A binary expression system requires a transactivator ('driver') that binds to a specific DNA sequence ('regulatory region' or 'effector'). A driver encoded by one transgenic locus or modified endogenous locus is used to drive expression of a downstream 'responder' or 'reporter' encoded by another transgenic locus or modified endogenous locus, by fusing the regulatory region sequence to which the driver binds upstream of the responder sequence. The temporal and spatial expression pattern of the responder thus depends on the regulatory elements used to drive expression of the driver. In addition, a specific repressor protein may be available which prevents the transactivator from driving expression, allowing further refinement of the expression pattern of the responder. Use of a temperature conditional repressor permits further refinement of this expression pattern."

Full expression develops in a species-specific manner, usually in response to a number of environmental stimuli that precede unfavorable conditions.

The recognition site contains perfect inverted repeats flanking an asymmetric spacer. Under normal conditions, the two recognition sites are identical and are reformed during the recombination event, and thus the reaction is bidirectional: recombination can occur in both 'forward' and 'reverse' directions. However, recognition sites can be mutated to drive the directionality of the reaction: different classes of site may be combined so that recombination can occur in one direction, but produces reformed sites that are no longer compatible. In addition, mutually exclusive sites have been engineered for some recombinases. Recombinases can be used to generate many different types of genetic modification, with the outcome being influenced by the relative orientation (direct or inverted), relative location and composition of the two recognition sites. The types of possible modification include deletion of DNA, generation of chromosomal rearrangements, integration of DNA into the genome, and replacement of genetic material with that from a donor plasmid using recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE)."

An integrase binds a pair of compatible recognition sites (typically called attP and attB) which each contain a short integration core flanked by imperfect inverted repeats that are not identical. Exchange between the attP/attB pair results in the formation of hybrid sites (typically called attL and attR) that are no longer a substrate of the integrase. Thus the exchange reaction driven by an integrase is unidirectional. Mutually exclusive pairs of recognition site have been engineered for some integrases. Integrases can be used to generate many different types of genetic modification, with the outcome being influenced by the relative orientation (direct or inverted), relative location and composition of the two recognition sites. The types of possible modification include deletion of DNA, generation of chromosomal rearrangements, integration of DNA into the genome, and replacement of genetic material with that from a donor plasmid using recombination-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE)."
