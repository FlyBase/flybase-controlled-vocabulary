# FlyBase miscellaneous ontologies - featuring the Drosophila Phenotype Ontology

This repository is a home for the development and release of a number of controlled vocabularies and ontologies developed and used by FlyBase, including the Drosophila phenotype ontology.

__To note:__ The code for these ontologies is for now still hosted [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/fbcv/code-0/HEAD/tree/). The trackers [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/fbcv/tickets/) are not in use anymore. Please submit new tickets [here](https://github.com/mmc46/flybase-controlled-vocabulary/issues).

These ontologies and CVs have historically been released as a single file (flybase_controlled_vocabulary.obo).  This file makes little sense as a single ontology,  so, while we will continue to release this combined file for legacy support purposes, this site aims to provide access to separate files for the various underlying ontologies.

Arguably the most important of the component ontologies is the Drosophila Phenotype Ontology (DPO) - which, as of April 2013 had been used to annotate over 160,000 phenotypes by FlyBase.  This site provides access to this as a separate ontology for the first time.
