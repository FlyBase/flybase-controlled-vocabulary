In an animal that is heterozygous for a Minute mutation, cells with two wild-type alleles of the affected gene have a growth advantage.

comment: Melanotic capsules are formed around wounds and foreign bodies in wild-type animals as part of the immune response, for example as a protection against parasitoid wasps. For the wild-type structure, consider FBbt:00005064. Some, but not all melanotic mass phenotypes involve ectopic activation of the same immune response. Melanotic masses caused by genetic manipulations are sometimes referred to as 'melanotic tumors' or 'pseudotumors', but this is a misnomer as they are rarely neoplastic (Minakhina and Steward, 2006).

Exocytosis can occur either by full fusion, when the vesicle collapses into the plasma membrane, or by a kiss-and-run mechanism that involves the formation of a transient contact, a pore, between a granule (for exemple of chromaffin cells) and the plasma membrane. The latter process most of the time leads to only partial secretion of the granule content. Exocytosis begins with steps that prepare vesicles for fusion with the membrane (tethering and docking) and ends when molecules are secreted from the cell.'" []

name: TALEN
namespace: origin_of_mutation
def: "Sequence change caused by the cleavage of specific DNA sequences by transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). TALEN proteins comprise a DNA binding domain fused to the catalytic domain of the FokI endonuclease. The DNA binding domain contains a repetitive region within the middle of the protein, consisting of tandem repeats of 34 amino acid segments, with each of these segments recognizing a single base pair. The specificity of the binding is determined by two hypervariable amino acids in positions 12 and 13 (repeat-variable diresidues). Cleavage requires dimerization of FokI. The endonuclease is directed to a target region by a pair of TALENs which bind to adjacent sequences separated by a spacer region, allowing dimerization and promoting cleavage."

ZFN proteins comprise a DNA binding domain linked to the DNA cleavage domain of FokI endonuclease. The DNA binding domain is composed of three Cys2His2 zinc fingers, with each zinc finger contacting three consecutive base pairs of DNA. The specificity of the binding is determined by the sequence of the three-zinc finger DNA binding domain, which recognizes a 9 base pair sequence. Cleavage requires dimerization of FokI. The endonuclease is directed to a target region by a pair of ZFNs which bind to sequences in close proximity, allowing dimerization and promoting cleavage."

def: "A protein trap cassette is designed to tag protein(s) encoded by an endogenous locus upon integration of the cassette into the genome. The basic structure of a protein trap cassette is an artificial exon composed of a splice acceptor site, an open reading frame without initiation and stop codons, and a splice donor site. No promoter sequences are present. Upon integration into a coding intron of an endogenous locus, the open reading frame (ORF) encoded by the artificial exon can be incorporated into ('tag') the protein encoded by the locus. This only occurs if the insertion is in the correct orientation and when the frame of the artificial exon corresponds to that of the preceeding exon. Thus, only one out of six insertions in a coding intron will function as a protein trap. To account for each reading frame, three versions of a given protein trap element, differing only in the splice phase, are typically produced for use in an insertional mutagenesis screen. Depending on the nature of the ORF encoded by the artificial exon, the tag may be used to detect the expression pattern and/or subcellular localization of the protein (e.g. if the tag is an epitope tag or fluorescent protein), to drive expression of a gene of interest (e.g. if the tag is a driver that forms part of a binary expression system), or may modify the properties of the endogenous protein (e.g. if the tag affects protein localization or stability). A protein trap cassette may be inserted into a genome as part of a transgenic construct via transposable-element-mediated transgenesis, or may be inserted directly into a modified endogenous locus via a genome engineering method such as homologous recombination or CRISPR. The presence of the splice acceptor and donor sites mean that a protein trap cassette is not inherently mutagenic, since it is designed to insert in frame into a protein. However, an insertion into an intron that splits a critical functional or localization domain may alter the activity of the encoded protein, and the protein trap tag sequence itself may be designed to alter function (for example targeting the protein to a new location within the cell or altering its stability)."

Any open reading frame (ORF) encoded by the trap cassette gene may be translated from this transcriptional fusion either as a translational fusion with any ORF sequence encoded by the upstream exons, or if an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) or viral 2A-like peptide sequence (which promotes ribosome skipping) is present upstream of the gene trap ORF, it may be produced as a separate protein expressed under the control of the regulatory sequences of the endogenous locus.

def: "Phenotype that is any abnormality in oviposition (GO:0018991) despite production of eggs. 'oviposition' is defined as: 'A reproductive behavior that results in the deposition of eggs (either fertilized or not) upon a surface or into a medium such as water.'." [FBC:TEMJ, GOC:ems, PMID:18050396, PMID:31164023]
comment: This term should only be used to report defects specifically in oviposition, as opposed to an overall loss of fertility. It is not possible to observe an oviposition abnormality if eggs are not being produced. If a difference in "oviposition rate" is measured by authors as a proxy for sterility/fertility, it would be better to use the terms "sterile", "semi-sterile", or "semi-fertile", as appropriate.

For RMCE mediated by a recombinase, the target cassette is flanked by two non-identical recombinase target sites that each carry a different mutation in the spacer sequence of the target site; this renders the two sites incompatible with each other. A compatible RMCE donor cassette is flanked by the same pair of non-identical sites; in the presence of recombinase, a double recombination event between the identical sites on the donor and target sequences results in replacement of the target cassette with the donor cassette.

def: "A docking element is an element that has been introduced into a site in the genome to allow integration of DNA at a defined location; this neutralizes the problem of position effects that are seen with non-specific insertion techniques such as transposable-element-mediated transgenesis. A docking element contains a single target site for an integrase, allowing subsequent integration of DNA into this site from a donor element via integrase mediated recombination. The docking element in the genome typically contains the 'attB' site and the donor plasmid contains the 'attP' site, since this directionality gives higher integration rates compared to the alternative combination where the 'attB' site is integrated into the genome. A docking element insertion is typically selected to be 'benign' (that is it does not result in disruption of an endogenous locus) and to show a high rate of integration in the presence of integrase." [FBC:GM, FlyBase:FBrf0192974, FlyBase:FBrf0194996, FlyBase:FBrf0231034, PMID:11359900, PMID:12563279]
comment: This includes any element containing a single site for integrase-mediated integration, as in FBrf0231034 Fig 10a, but not elements with multiple integrase sites, as in FBrf0231034 Fig 10b (see FBcv:0007042 - RMCE target element). Elements with sites for recombinase-mediated exchange (as in FBrf0231034 Fig 10c) are only included if they additionally carry exactly one integrase site for integrase-mediated integration.

comment: Note that this relation was previously called "inheres in", but was changed to be called "characteristic of" because BFO2 uses "inheres in" in a more restricted fashion. This relation differs from BFO2:inheres_in in two respects: (1) it does not impose a range constraint, and thus it allows qualities of processes, as well as of information entities, whereas BFO2 restricts inheres_in to only apply to independent continuants (2) it is declared functional, i.e. something can only be a characteristic of one thing.

comment: This relation is modeled after the BFO relation of the same name which was in BFO2, but is used in a more restricted sense - specifically, we model this relation as functional (inherited from characteristic-of). Note that this relation is now removed from BFO2020.

comment: This relation has a stronger meaning than merely indicating that X may develop into Y, in that the capability of developing into Y is always present, even if X does not always actually develop into Y. In particular, this means that if Y is restricted to a given taxon T, X is necessarily likewise restricted.
