It is not necessarily due to an increase in cell growth -it may be the result of an increase in the division rate at normal growth rates.

def: "Phenotype that is reduction in or loss of a stereotypical behavioral response to touch." [FlyBase:FBrf0073546]
comment: This phenotype is commonly assayed by scoring larval avoidance responses following stroking of the thoracic segments (see Kernan et al., 1994).  On its own, this is not sufficient evidence for a defect in sensory perception of touch, as motor defects can also cause this phenotype.

In an animal that is heterozygous for a Minute mutation, cells with two wild-type alleles of the affected gene have a growth advantage.

Some, but not all melanotic mass phenotypes involve ectopic activation of this immune response.

Associated characteristics of this form of dormancy include reduced morphogenesis, increased resistance to environmental extremes, and altered or reduced behavioral activity. Full expression develops in a species-specific manner, usually in response to a number of environmental stimuli that precede unfavorable conditions. Once diapause has begun, metabolic activity is suppressed even if conditions favorable for development prevail. Once initiated, only certain stimuli are capable of releasing the organism from this state, and this characteristic is essential in distinguishing diapause from hibernation.'" [FBC:DOS]

def: "Sequence change caused by the cleavage of specific DNA sequences by transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). TALEN proteins comprise a DNA binding domain fused to the catalytic domain of the FokI endonuclease. The DNA binding domain contains a repetitive region within the middle of the protein, consisting of tandem repeats of 34 amino acid segments, with each of these segments recognizing a single base pair. The specificity of the binding is determined by two hypervariable amino acids in positions 12 and 13 (repeat-variable diresidues). Cleavage requires dimerization of FokI. The endonuclease is directed to a target region by a pair of TALENs which bind to adjacent sequences separated by a spacer region, allowing dimerization and promoting cleavage."

def: "Sequence change caused by the cleavage of specific DNA sequences by zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs). ZFN proteins comprise a DNA binding domain linked to the DNA cleavage domain of FokI endonuclease. The DNA binding domain is composed of three Cys2His2 zinc fingers, with each zinc finger contacting three consecutive base pairs of DNA. The specificity of the binding is determined by the sequence of the three-zinc finger DNA binding domain, which recognizes a 9 base pair sequence. Cleavage requires dimerization of FokI. The endonuclease is directed to a target region by a pair of ZFNs which bind to sequences in close proximity, allowing dimerization and promoting cleavage."

comment: There are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'. In this case the quality is 'lacking all parts of type' - it is a (relational) quality of the spermatocyte, and it is with respect to instances of 'aster'. One of the popular requirements of PATO is that it continue to support 'absent', so we need to relate statements which use this quality to the 'lacking all parts of type' quality.\nThere are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'.

comment: PATO divides qualities between normal (monadic, singly-occurring) qualities and relational qualities. Relational qualities stand in the 'towards' relation with respect to some additional entity. For example, The sensitivity of an eye towards red light. In some cases we want to represent a quality such as 'protruding' in both monadic and relational branches. We use this relation to link them.\nPATO divides qualities between normal (monadic, singly-occurring) qualities and relational qualities.
