comment: This phenotype is not necessarily accompanied by overgrowth of a tissue - there may be more cells in an otherwise normal volume of tissue. It is not necessarily due to an increase in cell growth -it may be the result of an increase in the division rate at normal growth rates.  It may not even be due to an increase in the cell division rate - a reduced rate of cell death while the division rate is normal could also achieve it.

comment: The phenotype may be a general result of mutations in essential components of the protein synthesis pathway, as a number of Minutes encode ribosomal proteins. In an animal that is heterozygous for a Minute mutation, cells with two wild-type alleles of the affected gene have a growth advantage. Many developmental studies take advantage of this fact to give somatic clones a growth advantage. The term 'Minute' should not be used to annotate the resulting phenotypes.

def: "Phenotype characterized by the formation of lumps of melanotic tissue inside the body in the absence of foreign bodies." [FlyBase:FBrf0094387, FlyBase:FBrf0194475]
comment: Melanotic capsules are formed around foreign bodies in wild-type animals as part of the immune response, for example as a protection against parasitoid wasps. Some, but not all melanotic mass phenotypes involve ectopic activation of this immune response. While melanotic masses are commonly referred to as melanotic tumors in the historical literature, this is a misnomer as they are rarely neoplastic.

def: "Sequence change caused by the cleavage of specific DNA sequences by transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). TALEN proteins comprise a DNA binding domain fused to the catalytic domain of the FokI endonuclease. The DNA binding domain contains a repetitive region within the middle of the protein, consisting of tandem repeats of 34 amino acid segments, with each of these segments recognizing a single base pair. The specificity of the binding is determined by two hypervariable amino acids in positions 12 and 13 (repeat-variable diresidues). Cleavage requires dimerization of FokI. The endonuclease is directed to a target region by a pair of TALENs which bind to adjacent sequences separated by a spacer region, allowing dimerization and promoting cleavage."

def: "Sequence change caused by the cleavage of specific DNA sequences by zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs). ZFN proteins comprise a DNA binding domain linked to the DNA cleavage domain of FokI endonuclease. The DNA binding domain is composed of three Cys2His2 zinc fingers, with each zinc finger contacting three consecutive base pairs of DNA. The specificity of the binding is determined by the sequence of the three-zinc finger DNA binding domain, which recognizes a 9 base pair sequence. Cleavage requires dimerization of FokI. The endonuclease is directed to a target region by a pair of ZFNs which bind to sequences in close proximity, allowing dimerization and promoting cleavage."

comment: Temporal ordering number - 570. DISAMBIGUATION: In Drosophila lab vernacular, the term 'pupal stage' is often used to refer to the entire period from formation of the puparium to eclosion. However, this does not correspond to the standard usage of 'pupal stage' for Cyclorrhaphous flies (for discussion see: FBrf0087128). Briefly: formation of the puparium (hardening of the larval cuticle) marks the beginning of the pre-pupal stage. The pupal stage begins following pupal/larval apolysis - detachment of the larval epidermis from the puparium. In Drosophila, the outward sign of the completion of apolysis is the eversion of the head and expulsion of the larval mouthparts (FBrf0036849). We use P-stage to refer to the stage from pupariation to eclosion, and restrict pupal stage to its standard usage.

Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this.

def: "Any biological process that results in permanent cessation of all vital functions of a cell. A cell should be considered dead when any one of the following molecular or morphological criteria is met: (1) the cell has lost the integrity of its plasma membrane; (2) the cell, including its nucleus, has undergone complete fragmentation into discrete bodies (frequently referred to as apoptotic bodies). The cell corpse (or its fragments) may be engulfed by an adjacent cell in vivo, but engulfment of whole cells should not be considered a strict criteria to define cell death as, under some circumstances, live engulfed cells can be released from phagosomes (see PMID:18045538)." [GOC:mah, GOC:mtg_apoptosis, PMID:25236395]
comment: This term should not be used for direct annotation. The only exception should be when experimental data (e.g., staining with trypan blue or propidium iodide) show that cell death has occurred, but fail to provide details on death modality (accidental versus programmed). When information is provided on the cell death mechanism, annotations should be made to the appropriate descendant of 'cell death' (such as, but not limited to, GO:0097300 'programmed necrotic cell death' or GO:0006915 'apoptotic process'). Also, if experimental data suggest that a gene product influences cell death indirectly, rather than being involved in the death process directly, consider annotating to a 'regulation' term.

name: sexual reproduction
namespace: biological_process
def: "A reproduction process that creates a new organism by combining the genetic material of two organisms. It occurs both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes: in multicellular eukaryotic organisms, an individual is created anew; in prokaryotes, the initial cell has additional or transformed genetic material. In a process called genetic recombination, genetic material (DNA) originating from two different individuals (parents) join up so that homologous sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. After the new recombinant chromosome is formed, it is passed on to progeny." [GOC:jl, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_reproduction, ISBN:0387520546]
comment: Sexual reproduction may be seen as the regular alternation, in the life cycle of haplontic, diplontic and diplohaplontic organisms, of meiosis and fertilization which provides for the production offspring. In diplontic organisms there is a life cycle in which the products of meiosis behave directly as gametes, fusing to form a zygote from which the diploid, or sexually reproductive polyploid, adult organism will develop. In diplohaplontic organisms a haploid phase (gametophyte) exists in the life cycle between meiosis and fertilization (e.g. higher plants, many algae and Fungi); the products of meiosis are spores that develop as haploid individuals from which haploid gametes develop to form a diploid zygote; diplohaplontic organisms show an alternation of haploid and diploid generations. In haplontic organisms meiosis occurs in the zygote, giving rise to four haploid cells (e.g. many algae and protozoa), only the zygote is diploid and this may form a resistant spore, tiding organisms over hard times.

comment: In plants and animals, dormancy may be a response to environmental conditions such as seasonality or extreme heat, drought, or cold. In plants, dormancy may involve the formation of dormant buds, and may be preceded by the senescence of plant parts such as leaves in woody plants or most of the shoot system in herbaceous perennials. The exit from dormancy in vascular plants is marked by resumed growth of buds and/or growth of vascular cambium.

Once diapause has begun, metabolic activity is suppressed even if conditions favorable for development prevail. Once initiated, only certain stimuli are capable of releasing the organism from this state, and this characteristic is essential in distinguishing diapause from hibernation."

comment: There are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'. In this case the quality is 'lacking all parts of type' - it is a (relational) quality of the spermatocyte, and it is with respect to instances of 'aster'. One of the popular requirements of PATO is that it continue to support 'absent', so we need to relate statements which use this quality to the 'lacking all parts of type' quality.\nThere are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'.

comment: PATO divides qualities between normal (monadic, singly-occurring) qualities and relational qualities. Relational qualities stand in the 'towards' relation with respect to some additional entity. For example, The sensitivity of an eye towards red light. In some cases we want to represent a quality such as 'protruding' in both monadic and relational branches. We use this relation to link them.\nPATO divides qualities between normal (monadic, singly-occurring) qualities and relational qualities.
