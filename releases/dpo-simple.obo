comment: The phenotype may be a general result of mutations in essential components of the protein synthesis pathway, as a number of Minutes encode ribosomal proteins. In an animal that is heterozygous for a Minute mutation, cells with two wild-type alleles of the affected gene have a growth advantage. Many developmental studies take advantage of this fact to give somatic clones a growth advantage. The term 'Minute' should not be used to annotate the resulting phenotypes.

Some, but not all melanotic mass phenotypes involve ectopic activation of this immune response.
